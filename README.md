### Overview 

This repository contains the Unity-side of the UR3e ROS Unity Project

### Before You Begin

1. Make sure that SteamVR is installed and running on your machine.
2. Make sure that you have a VR headset connected to your machine.
3. Make sure you complete the initial SteamVR Room Setup.

```

2. Open the project in Unity Hub:

The project is built in the Unity 2023.3.12f1 version.

3. Start the ROS-side by cloning the below repo:

See [UR3e_unity](https://github.com/Yadhukrishnank/UR3e_unity.git) for more information.

4. Open the `VR Robotic Workspace` scene by navigating to `Assets > Scenes > VR Robotic Workspace` from within the
Unity Editor.

5. Start the Unity-side package:

Hit the play button in the Unity Editor to start the package. Please note that
at this point you should have SteamVR running with a VR headset (We used a Meta Quest 3 for testing) connected and
the ROS-side running.

The robot should snap into position and you may begin interacting with the
robot and additional objects in the scene.
